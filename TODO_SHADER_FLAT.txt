If maxTransitions is known to be small (<= 64), consider using a fixed-size array

If possible, precompute (translateZ - z2 / 2) on CPU and pass as uniform

Profile with different workgroup sizes (e.g., 32x8, 16x16)

Consider using subgroup operations if available in your hardware







âœ… 1. Further parallelize over Z
Idea:
Break the merge into parallel work across the Z-dimension (e.g. one thread per transition).

Pros:
Can leverage much higher total thread count.

Good for very deep voxel grids (z1 â‰« 256).

Cons:
Hard to synchronize per-column state (obj1On/obj2On) across Z.

Boolean logic is inherently sequential â€” transitions flip on/off state in order, so Z-parallelism is not naturally compatible.

Verdict:
ðŸ”» Not suited here. Your boolean transition scan is inherently serial over Z (like prefix scan).
â†’ This would not help much and adds complexity.

âœ… 2. Switch to 2-pass out-of-place writes
Idea:
Instead of writing back into obj1_flatData, use an intermediate buffer for output, then copy it back in a second pass if needed.

Pros:
Avoids in-place writes and padding.

Enables simpler memory writes and potentially coalesced output.

Great for pipelines where you process outputs further before committing.

Cons:
Slight overhead from second pass or copy.

Requires allocating another buffer.

Verdict:
ðŸŸ¡ Medium gain. Useful if your final data goes into a post-process step (e.g., rendering, compression).
â†’ If you're writing large volumes, it can help reduce cache thrashing and simplify memory patterns.

âœ… 3. Use shared memory for cooperative merge
Idea:
For each XY column (i.e., each workgroup), use shared memory to:

Load input transitions (obj1 + obj2) cooperatively,

Do the merge + boolean op in shared memory,

Write compacted result back.

Pros:
Big reduction in global memory access latency.

Great for bandwidth-bound workloads (yours is).

Best if maxTransitions per column is not huge (e.g. â‰¤ 128â€“256).

Cons:
Limited shared memory (typically 48â€“64 KB per SM).

Only helps if threads in workgroup cooperate (1 per XY column is good).

Requires tuning and careful bounds handling.

Verdict:
âœ… Best candidate for large speedup.
â†’ Your shader is limited by global memory traffic and serialized transition merging, so putting data in shared memory, processing in place, and writing out only once = massive win.
