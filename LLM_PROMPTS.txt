I want a voxelizeZ function which:  
(i) renders a block of slices of my volume and stores them  
(ii) launches a compute shader which compares each pair of consecutive slices checking for red->black or black->red transitions  
(iii) stores the transitions in a buffer array  
(iv) for each x,y pair, stores the number of transitions for that z "column" in a separate array.  

Please note:  
(a) when I go from a block to the next, the last slice of the previous block should be used to make the comparison to detect transitions.  
    For the first block, this slice is considered as composed of all black pixels.  
(b) the comparison between slices must be done using a compute shader  
(c) the number of slices per block must be parametrized by SLICES_PER_BLOCK  
(d) the resolution in the xy plane is RESOLUTION x RESOLUTION, while in the Z direction the resolution can be different (RESOLUTION_Z).  

Please provide both the host code and a working compute shader.
